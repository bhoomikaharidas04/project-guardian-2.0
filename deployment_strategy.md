# Deployment Strategy for Real-Time PII Redaction

## 1. Deployment Layer
- Deploy as a **Sidecar container** in microservices architecture.
- Every microservice handling customer data will have this sidecar intercept all incoming/outgoing data.

## 2. Justification
- **Latency:** Minimal, as processing happens alongside service.
- **Scalability:** Sidecars scale automatically with service replicas.
- **Ease of Integration:** No changes needed to existing services.
- **Cost-effective:** Uses existing compute resources of microservices.

## 3. Monitoring & Logging
- Logs PII detection events (without storing actual PII).
- Alerts triggered for suspicious patterns or repeated leaks.

## 4. Optional Enhancements
- GPU acceleration for ML/NLP based detection.
- API Gateway plugin to cover external integrations.
